# Data Science Course


This is the code I made in a Data Science course.

In this course, I learnt several machine learning algorithms in Python, such as:
 * Linear Regression (Simple and Multiple)
 * Logistic Regression
 * Clustering (K-Means)
 * Neural Networks (TensorFlow 2.0)

Some of the most interesting projects I made were:
 * MNIST: Images of numbers recognition with neural networks
 * Audiobooks: Prediction whether a customer will buy a book by using neural networks
 * Absenteeism: Logistic regression to analyze the factors that may cause job absenteeism
